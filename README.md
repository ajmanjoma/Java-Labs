#Java Labs

Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

Step 1: Install Java compiler

To run a Java program, you need to compile the program first. You need Java compiler for this purpose.

The Java compiler is part of JDK (Java Development Kit). You need to install JDK in order to compile and run Java programs.

First, check if you already have Java Compiler installed on your system:

$ javac --version

The simplest way to install JDK on Ubuntu is to go with the default offering from Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt install default-jdk

Step 2: Compile Java program in Linux

You need to have a Java program file for this reason. Letâ€™s say you create a new Java program file named file_name.java

You can use Nano editor in terminal or Gedit graphical text editor for writing your Java programs.

javac file_name.java

Step 3: Run the Java class file

You do not need to specify the class extension here. Just the name of the class. And this time, you use the command java, not javac.

java class_name
